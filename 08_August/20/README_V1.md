When I played last 2 years ago, the game would repeatedly pop up an error saying that it couldn't connect to the server (the server has been down for a long time, and isn't coming back) the game could still play normally, but this error would come up constantly.

The error has still not recurred. - 2023, Thursday, August 3rd to 2023, Sunday, August 6th
