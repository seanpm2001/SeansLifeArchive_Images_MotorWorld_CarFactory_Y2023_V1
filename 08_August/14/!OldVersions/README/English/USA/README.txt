# 2023 August 14th

## Session skipped

I re-adjusted my 2023, Sunday, August 13th schedule to begin early in the day, due to some problems from last night. I was unable to play during the day today (2023, Monday, August 14th) so the session was skipped, and a nighttime session for 2023, Tuesday, August 15th is planned instead. This is an OK thing to do every once in a while for re-adjustment. I will try to do this less frequently.
