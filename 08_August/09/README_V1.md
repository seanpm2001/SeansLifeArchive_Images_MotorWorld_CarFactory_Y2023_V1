### Server down

<details><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse older entries</b></p></summary>

When I played last 2 years ago, the game would repeatedly pop up an error saying that it couldn't connect to the server (the server has been down for a long time, and isn't coming back) the game could still play normally, but this error would come up constantly. After my 1.9 year hiatus, I have found that the error never comes up now. - 2023, Wednesday, August 2nd

The error has still not recurred. - 2023, Thursday, August 3rd

The error has still not recurred. I have been starting to wonder what the logo at the top is (the developer network for before the server went down) this was once a fairly popular game on iOS (how I found it originally) so there should be some documentaiton out there. - 2023, Monday, August 7th
