# Motor World Car Factory session log

## Phase 2, day 1 (2023, Wednesday, August 2nd)

### Overview

I finally resumed gameplay of this game today, after a hiatus that almost lasted 2 full years. I started after midnight. This is going to continue on a daily basis. - 2023, Wednesday, August 2nd

### Main factory

After returning, everything was the same as when I played nearly 2 full years ago. I produced new cars until I ran out of donuts. - 2023, Wednesday, August 2nd

#### Cars

I started to produce and sell some new Berliner Donks, but then switched to Sunny Roadsters, so that I could unlock another car type. - 2023, Wednesday, August 2nd

#### Research

I began researching V8 engines today. - 2023, Wednesday, August 2nd

#### Shops

I collected from my shops, and made no progress on building new shops. - 2023, Wednesday, August 2nd

#### Donuts

**Capacity:** `37` _(as of `2023.08.02`)_

I used up all of my donuts before quitting. - 2023, Wednesday, August 2nd

#### Level up

On 2023, Wednesday, August 2nd, I leveled up to level 40. - 2023, Wednesday, August 2nd

### Edge screen issues

There were no application issues regarding edge screen issues, and internal zooming today. - 2023, Wednesday, August 2nd

### Server down

When I played last 2 years ago, the game would repeatedly pop up an error saying that it couldn't connect to the server (the server has been down for a long time, and isn't coming back) the game could still play normally, but this error would come up constantly. After my 1.9 year hiatus, I have found that the error never comes up now. - 2023, Wednesday, August 2nd
