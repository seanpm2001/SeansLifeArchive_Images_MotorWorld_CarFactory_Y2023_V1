# 2023 August 23rd

## Session skipped

I took the night off on my 2023, Sunday, August 23rd schedule due to time issues, and hopeful attempts to get caught back up on documentation here. This is an OK thing to do every once in a while for re-adjustment. I will try to do this infrequently. This is the second time to date. I will play again on 2023, Thursday, August 24th.
